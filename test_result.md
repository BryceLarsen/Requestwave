# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "COMPREHENSIVE THREE-STATE SYSTEM TESTING COMPLETE - CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED: Extensive testing reveals the three-state subscription system is partially implemented but has 5 critical issues preventing proper operation. ✅ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: Core three-state system is implemented with proper endpoints (/subscription/checkout, /billing/confirm, /subscription/status, /stripe/webhook) and Pro access gating functions (get_current_pro_musician, require_pro_access, check_pro_access). ✅ STRIPE INTEGRATION: Webhook endpoint exists and validates signatures correctly, checkout endpoints handle validation properly. ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE #1 - 403 RESPONSE FORMAT: All Pro-gated endpoints return {'detail': {'message': '...'}} instead of required {'message': '...'} format. This affects song-suggestions, playlists, and all Pro features. ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE #2 - STRIPE CONFIGURATION: Missing STRIPE_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY_10 and STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ANNUAL_48 environment variables prevent checkout flow from working (returns 400 errors). ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE #3 - BILLING CONFIRM AUTHENTICATION: GET /api/billing/confirm requires authentication but should be accessible for return flow from Stripe checkout (breaks Free→Trial transition). ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE #4 - SUBSCRIPTION STATUS PLAN VALUES: Returns plan='active' instead of plan='pro' for Pro users, violating three-state system specification (plan should be 'free' or 'pro'). ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE #5 - ERROR LOGGING: Most error responses missing error_id field required for structured logging. SUCCESS RATE: 40% (2/5 critical areas working). The three-state system foundation is solid but needs these 5 critical fixes before it can function properly."

        comment: "CRITICAL THREE-STATE SYSTEM FIXES VERIFICATION COMPLETE - MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS ACHIEVED: Comprehensive testing of the three critical fixes shows significant progress with 91.7% success rate (11/12 tests passed). ✅ CRITICAL FIX #1 VERIFIED - 403 RESPONSE FORMAT FIXED: get_current_pro_musician() and require_pro_access() now return correct plain string format 'Pro feature — start your 14-day free trial to unlock your Audience Link.' instead of nested JSON. All Pro-gated endpoints (song-suggestions, playlists) consistently return proper 403 format. ✅ CRITICAL FIX #2 VERIFIED - BILLING CONFIRM AUTHENTICATION FIXED: GET /api/billing/confirm is now accessible without authentication, properly extracts musician_id from Stripe session metadata, handles various session_id formats correctly, and allows unauthenticated return flow from Stripe checkout. ✅ CRITICAL FIX #3 VERIFIED - SUBSCRIPTION STATUS PLAN VALUES FIXED: GET /api/subscription/status now returns plan='pro' for Pro users (not plan='active'), maintains three-state system compliance with valid plan values ('free'|'pro'), and shows consistent status values. ✅ STRIPE INTEGRATION STILL WORKS: Checkout endpoints accessible with proper configuration error messages, subscription status endpoint working correctly, environment variables properly mapped. ❌ REMAINING ISSUE - DATA CONSISTENCY: Pro user database has subscription_status='active' but missing plan/status fields, causing check_pro_access() to fail while subscription status endpoint works correctly. This is a data migration issue, not a code fix issue. SUCCESS RATE: 91.7% - The three critical fixes are working correctly and have dramatically improved the system from 40% to 91.7% success rate as expected."

Please contact support to complete the subscription setup.' This is a major improvement for production debugging. ✅ WEBHOOK URL CONSISTENCY FIXED: POST /api/stripe/webhook endpoint is accessible and properly validates webhook signatures (returns 'Missing signature' for unsigned requests). ✅ WEBHOOK SECRET VALIDATION: Improved validation detects missing Stripe signatures and provides clear error messages. ✅ STRIPE API KEY VALIDATION: Enhanced validation in checkout endpoint catches placeholder/missing API keys and provides helpful configuration guidance. ✅ ANNUAL PRICING UPDATED: No references to old $24 pricing found, system properly configured for $48 annual pricing.

ISSUE ANALYSIS: The reported issue 'playlists not showing up in All Playlists tab' and 'not appearing in existing playlists dropdown' appears to be a FRONTEND issue, not backend. Backend APIs are returning all playlist data correctly. Recommendation: Check frontend caching, data refresh, or UI display logic."

This explains why playlists might not show in frontend despite backend working. ✅ ROOT CAUSE: Two different subscription systems - freemium system (used by frontend) returns 'canceled', legacy system (used by check_pro_access) apparently still grants access. ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE: The subscription status endpoint and Pro access logic use different systems, creating inconsistency. Frontend fix addressed part of the issue but there's still a mismatch for users with 'canceled' status who should have access. RECOMMENDATION: Either update check_pro_access to use freemium system, or update frontend to handle 'canceled' users who still have valid access, or ensure both systems return consistent results."

Error: {'detail':[{'type':'missing','loc':['query','status'],'msg':'Field required'}]}. This indicates the endpoint expects status updates via query parameters rather than the expected JSON body format. ❌ RESPONSE FORMAT MISMATCH: GET /requests/updates/{musician_id} returns {'requests': [...], 'timestamp': '...'} instead of expected format {'requests': [...], 'total_requests': N, 'last_updated': '...'}. The endpoint uses 'timestamp' field instead of 'last_updated' and is missing 'total_requests' field entirely. ✅ BASIC REQUEST FLOW WORKING: Audience request submission through POST /musicians/{slug}/requests is functional and requests appear in real-time polling.

SOLUTION: Changed FastAPI imports to use 'Request as FastAPIRequest' and updated all webhook and utility functions to use 'FastAPIRequest' instead of 'Request'. This resolves the routing conflict where webhook requests were being routed to request creation handlers.
