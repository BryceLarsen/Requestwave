The AI engineer's work trajectory encompassed two major phases. Initially, attempts were made to enhance the audience search page by integrating artist social media links as buttons and making the artist's bio collapsible. This phase encountered significant technical challenges, including persistent lint errors, UI rendering issues, and failed attempts at debugging component loading states, ultimately remaining unresolved. Subsequently, the focus shifted entirely to implementing a comprehensive freemium subscription model with Stripe integration. This involved extensive backend modifications to  (adding new models, payment endpoints, webhook handlers, and access control logic) and corresponding frontend updates in  (UI for subscription management, state handling, and access gating). The primary challenge in this phase has been resolving complex backend routing conflicts and endpoint registration issues, compounded by persistent 404/500 errors and parameter injection problems, with the current issue being the incorrect usage of  in FastAPI. The engineer has methodically attempted to debug these, including adding route logging and temporarily re-pathing endpoints.

<product_requirements>
The RequestWave application empowers musicians to manage their song repertoire, engage audiences with real-time song requests and tips, and monetize performances. It supports diverse song import methods (CSV, manual, Spotify/Apple Music) and offers flexible filtering. The application features a freemium model with trial periods and Stripe-based Pro plan subscriptions, focusing on efficient engagement and monetization through real-time functionality.

Recent requirements added during this trajectory include:
1.  **Audience Interface Enhancement**: On the audience search page, display artist social media links as buttons and make the artist's bio collapsible with a dropdown, all while maintaining the existing header bar size.
2.  **Comprehensive Freemium Model**: Implement a Stripe-integrated freemium model where the artist dashboard remains free, but audience links and QR codes are paywalled. This includes a one-time startup fee (5) and recurring monthly () or annual (4) subscriptions with a 30-day free trial for first-time subscribers. The system must minimize Stripe transactions, re-charge the startup fee for reactivations, manage  status via webhooks (, , ), provide a graceful payment failure grace period, and enforce access by showing a page paused screen if the link is inactive. Account deletion requires explicit confirmation.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the advanced stages of implementing a comprehensive freemium subscription model with Stripe integration. This work has involved significant modifications across both the backend () and frontend ().

On the **backend**, the engineer has:
1.  Defined new Pydantic models for subscription plans and statuses.
2.  Updated the  model to include critical fields like  and .
3.  Implemented new FastAPI endpoints for Stripe checkout, subscription cancellation, webhook handling, and fetching subscription status.
4.  Integrated audience access checks into existing song and request endpoints, ensuring paywall enforcement.
5.  Removed old, conflicting subscription models and endpoints to streamline the system.
6.  Added extensive diagnostic routes (, , ) and a  for debugging persistent routing issues.

On the **frontend**, the engineer has:
1.  Added new React state variables to manage subscription status and trial information.
2.  Updated existing functions () and created new ones () to interact with the new Stripe-integrated backend.
3.  Introduced a dedicated Subscription tab in the musician dashboard UI.
4.  Implemented an Access Denied screen for audience members who attempt to access a paywalled musician's page without an active subscription.
5.  Temporarily adjusted API call paths to  for debugging routing issues, then reverted to .

The most recent work has been focused on debugging critical backend routing conflicts and endpoint registration failures. The  and diagnostic endpoints were introduced to pinpoint why the newly defined freemium endpoints were consistently returning 404 Not Found errors, even after confirming their correct placement and syntax. The immediate last identified issue (Chat 564) was an incorrect usage of  on individual  decorators instead of on the  instance itself. This fix has just been applied. The application is currently in a state where the core freemium logic is largely coded, but its backend API endpoints are not yet reliably accessible due to these persistent routing/registration challenges.

<optional_next_step>
Test the backend again to verify that fixing the  error resolves the endpoint registration issues for the freemium APIs.
