The previous AI engineer successfully transitioned the RequestWave application from an initial MVP to a comprehensive freemium model with integrated Stripe payments and significant UI/UX improvements. The work progressed through several distinct phases. Initially, persistent backend routing conflicts, especially with Stripe webhooks and FastAPI's path parameter matching, consumed significant effort. The engineer meticulously debugged these by reordering routes, creating separate routers, and adding diagnostic logging. Concurrently, the frontend was updated to reflect the new 14-day trial, corrected pricing, and unlimited requests messaging, along with fixing a critical checkout error. Finally, extensive UI refinements were made to remove Pro badging from various features (Song Suggestions, Design tab, Photo Upload, Analytics tab) and convert static buttons to more user-friendly toggles and dropdowns, significantly enhancing the free tier experience.

<product_requirements>
The RequestWave application enables musicians to manage songs, handle requests/tips, and monetize performances, supporting various import methods. It implements a freemium model with a trial and Stripe subscriptions.

The product requirements evolved over the trajectory:
1.  **Audience Interface (Initial, Unresolved):** Display artist social media links as buttons and make the artist's bio collapsible on the audience search page.
2.  **Comprehensive Freemium Model (Core):** Implement Stripe-integrated freemium. Artist dashboard is free; audience links/QR codes are paywalled. Includes a 5 one-time startup fee and recurring monthly () or annual (8) subscriptions, with a 14-day free trial. The system must minimize Stripe transactions, re-charge startup fees for reactivations, manage  via webhooks (, , ), and enforce access with a page paused screen if inactive. Account deletion requires confirmation.
3.  **Frontend UI Alignment:** Update frontend to reflect 14-day trial (remove 20 free requests), correct pricing (8/year, total 3 with startup), change checkout button to Start Free Trial Now, and replace the requests used bar with an Upgrade Now button.
4.  **Feature Access & UI Simplification:** Make Song Suggestions a toggle switch and available to all users. Remove Pro badges/restrictions from the Design tab, artist logo, photo upload, and Analytics tab.
5.  **UI Consolidation:** Convert the five song management buttons (Auto-fill all, Add a new song, Import Playlist, Upload CSV, Upload LST) into a single dropdown menu.
6.  **Responsive Design:** On mobile/smaller screens, move Welcome [artist name] under the RequestWave logo and collapse main tabs into a dropdown. Desktop UI should remain unchanged.
7.  **Quick Start Guide:** Remove the automatic popup on login, ensuring the guide is still accessible via the '?' button on both mobile and desktop.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer has just completed a series of frontend UI updates. The immediate last task was to remove the PRO icon from the artist photo line within the design tab, which was confirmed as successfully implemented. This aligns with the broader goal of making more features accessible to all users within the new 14-day free trial model.

Specifically, the following key UI changes were recently completed and verified by the previous engineer:
-   The Start - 0 today / Start - 3 today checkout buttons were changed to Start Free Trial Now on the subscription tab.
-   The orange bar showing request usage on the profile tab was replaced with an Upgrade Now button.
-   The 30-day trial messaging was updated to 14-day trial across the frontend.
-   Annual pricing displays were corrected to 8 (from 4).
-   20 free requests language was removed, replaced with unlimited requests during trial.
-   Song suggestions were converted to a toggle switch and made available to all users.
-   Pro badges were removed from the Design tab, Artist Photo upload, and Analytics tab.
-   The five song management buttons were consolidated into a single dropdown menu.
-   Responsive design was implemented for mobile, collapsing navigation and repositioning welcome text.
-   The Quick Start Guide's automatic popup on login was removed, while keeping it accessible via a '?' button.

All these recent changes reflect the new business logic where many features are now part of the standard free trial experience, aiming for a cleaner, more consistent user interface. The frontend should now perfectly match the updated backend subscription model.
