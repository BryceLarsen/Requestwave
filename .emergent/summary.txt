The AI engineer systematically addressed critical bugs and implemented significant feature enhancements for the RequestWave application. The trajectory began by resolving a reported login issue and then moved into core application improvements. Key feature additions included a Quick Start Guide with a downloadable CSV starter setlist, refined playlist import logic to remove extraneous notes, and the implementation of a curated genre/mood categorization system. Crucial bug fixes involved robust error handling for batch song deletion, ensuring  file uploads are supported, and, most notably, persistent debugging of deployment-related routing issues affecting QR codes and the On Stage mode. The engineer identified hardcoded preview URLs and resolved frontend polling and authentication issues, leading to functional real-time updates and interactive buttons in On Stage mode. Finally, the engineer overhauled the Requests page with a folder-like layout, collapsible sections, batch operations (play, reject, delete), and fixed timestamp display across the application to automatically adapt to local timezones. The work demonstrates strong problem-solving skills, utilizing various diagnostic tools and a methodical approach to complex full-stack issues.

<product_requirements>
The RequestWave application enables musicians to manage their song repertoire and interact with audiences for real-time song requests and tips. It supports multiple import methods (CSV, manual, Spotify/Apple Music) and offers flexible song filtering by genre, artist, mood, year, and decade. The app features a freemium model with trial periods and Pro plan subscriptions via Stripe. Recent enhancements include comprehensive song management capabilities like batch editing, popularity tracking, analytics integration, and show management. A Pro song suggestion system allows audiences to suggest songs. User experience has been continuously refined through improvements like a Quick Start Guide, a mobile-optimized On Stage mode for real-time request display, and intuitive UI updates for managing requests and song suggestions. The overarching goal is to provide a robust, responsive, and efficient platform for musicians to engage their audience and monetize their performances, with a focus on real-time functionality and ease of use.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack structure.



- **/app/backend/server.py**: Core FastAPI backend.
  - **Importance**: Centralizes API endpoints for authentication, song/playlist management, request queue, profile updates, and payment integrations. Interacts with MongoDB.
  - **Changes Made**:
    - **Playlist Import Notes**: Modified , , and  to leave the  field blank for imported songs (Chat 56, 58, 66).
    - **Curated Genre/Moods**: Updated , , , and various hardcoded sample/default songs/suggestions to use a predefined list of 20 genres and 20 moods (Chat 107, 109, 113, 117, 121, 125, 127, 141, 147, 151, 155, 159, 161, 165, 169, 173, 183).
    - **LST File Upload**: Added new functions like  and new FastAPI endpoints (, ) to support importing songs from  files with Song Title - Artist format (Chat 251, 253, 261).
    - **QR Code/On Stage URL Fix**: Corrected hardcoded preview URLs in  environment variable (through ) and a fallback URL in  to point to the deployed production URL (Chat 301, 311).
    - **Missing Audience Request Endpoint**: Added a new FastAPI endpoint  to allow audience members to submit requests specific to a musician's slug, integrating it with the existing request creation logic (Chat 369).
    - **On Stage Request Status Update**: Modified  to properly accept status in a JSON body via a Pydantic model, rather than query parameters, and fixed the real-time polling endpoint to filter out archived requests (Chat 396, 401).

- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Main React component.
  - **Importance**: Manages routing, global state, UI for musician/audience dashboards, and all frontend logic for backend interaction.
  - **Changes Made**:
    - **Quick Start Guide**: Added a prominent download button for a starter CSV setlist within the Quick Start Guide modal (Chat 25).
    - **Batch Song Deletion**: Modified batch song deletion logic () to handle partial failures gracefully, instead of failing entirely on a single error (Chat 199).
    - **Notes Tab Search**: Added  state, updated  logic to include notes search, added a new notes search input field to the UI, adjusted the grid layout from 6 to 7 columns, and updated  to include notes (Chat 220, 222, 224, 230, 236).
    - **LST File Upload UI**: Added UI elements (state variables, handling functions, buttons, section) for  file uploads, mirroring the CSV upload functionality (Chat 265, 267, 273, 279). Also updated Quick Start Guide to mention  files (Chat 281).
    - **On Stage Mode Polling/Buttons**: Fixed  to fetch real requests from the backend API instead of hardcoded demo data (Chat 425, 429). Added explicit authentication headers to the  function within  to enable Accept/Play/Reject buttons (Chat 450). Restructured polling logic to start only after musician data is loaded and enhanced error handling to prevent polling from stopping (Chat 479, 485).
    - **Requests Page Layout & Batch Edit**: Rearranged the Requests tab to show show folders above All Requests and made All Requests collapsible. Removed the Accept button. Implemented batch selection checkboxes and a batch action bar for Mark all as Played, Mark all as Rejected, and Delete all selected for requests (Chat 464, 466, 468).
    - **Batch Edit/Delete Song Suggestions**: Added batch selection state, batch action functions (, , ), and updated the song suggestions UI with checkboxes and a batch actions bar (Chat 495, 497, 501).
    - **Timestamp Localization**: Created  and  utility functions to display timestamps in the user's local timezone automatically. Applied these functions across all relevant timestamp displays on the Requests page, Song Suggestions, On Stage interface, Analytics tab, and Subscription info (Chat 510, 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522).

<pending_tasks>
- Frontend testing for the Phase 3 Analytics Dashboard.
- Adding a prominent green tip button on the audience song search page, leading to tipping functionality (distinct from the post-request modal).

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully implemented automatic timezone detection and display across the entire application. Previously, timestamps were likely showing in UTC, leading to confusion. The engineer addressed this by:

1.  **Creating Utility Functions**: Introduced  for full date/time and  for time-only display. These functions leverage  for automatic device timezone detection.
2.  **Global Integration**: Applied these new formatting functions to all timestamps displayed on the Requests page, Song Suggestions section, On Stage interface, Analytics tab, and Subscription information.
3.  **Refining On Stage Sorting**: Updated the sorting logic in the On Stage interface to directly use the formatted timestamp for consistency.

This ensures that all time-related data is now accurately presented in the user's local timezone, enhancing the user experience, especially for musicians managing live performances where precise timing of requests and suggestions is crucial. The last action was a frontend restart to apply these changes, and the engineer has confirmed the successful resolution of the timezone issue.
