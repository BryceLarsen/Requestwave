The AI engineer's trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive approach to evolving an MVP application, prioritizing bug fixes and feature enhancements based on user feedback. The work began by confirming existing features and immediately shifted to user-identified problems and new requirements. Key phases included resolving a critical Venmo tipping link bug, implementing a decade song filtering system, introducing an intuitive song editing modal, fixing payment system routing conflicts, ensuring profile data persistence, enhancing show management (including deletion capabilities), adding a random song selector, and developing a robust bulk editing system. The most significant recent feature is the song suggestion system, which was implemented as a Pro feature with detailed backend and frontend components. Throughout, the engineer systematically addressed UI/UX issues, backend logic, and data models, often identifying and fixing follow-up bugs, such as the batch edit display error. The work flow consistently involved understanding the existing codebase, implementing changes, and thorough testing, often identifying deeper underlying issues. The last action involved incorporating a new application logo.

The RequestWave application enables real-time interaction between musicians and their audience. Musicians manage song lists (via CSV, manual add/edit/delete, playlist import) and handle real-time requests with dedications and tips (Stripe, PayPal/Venmo). The audience can browse/filter songs via QR code, make requests, and tip. The app includes a responsive web app, JWT authentication, MongoDB, and comprehensive filtering (Genre, Artist, Mood, Year). It operates on a freemium model (trial, monthly requests, Pro plan), supports mobile optimization, and offers Pro design options. Recent enhancements have introduced advanced song list filtering, batch editing/deletion with CSV export, song popularity tracking, an analytics dashboard, and automatic song metadata enrichment via Spotify API. Key features like artist-controlled show management, social media integration, and a random song selector have been added. The application now also includes an automatic decade categorization and filtering for songs, a more user-friendly song edit modal, full request and show deletion capabilities, and a new song suggestion system with Pro feature access control. The Stripe subscription system has been fully configured for live payments.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of incorporating a newly provided application logo into the RequestWave application's user interface. The logo features a purple and green gradient with a microphone and sound wave design, intended to enhance brand identity and user experience.

Prior to this summary request, the first step of this task was successfully completed: the logo was added to the **login/registration page** (). This ensures that the brand identity is immediately visible to users upon their first interaction with the application.

The next step in the logo incorporation, which was about to begin or in progress, is to add a smaller version of this logo to the **main dashboard header** to ensure consistent branding throughout the musician's experience. This follows a logical progression of placing the logo in key, high-visibility areas of the application.

<optional_next_step>
Incorporate the new RequestWave logo into the main dashboard header.
