The AI engineer systematically evolved the RequestWave application from an MVP, integrating a freemium model, advanced playlist/request management, and comprehensive UI/UX overhauls. Key additions included a 3-step audience request flow with tipping, musician control toggles, and an enhanced login page. The engineer resolved numerous bugs, such as QR code URL mismatches, Zelle field persistence, and mobile dropdown visibility. Significant architectural changes involved converting On Stage to a dedicated tab, redesigning audience view filters, and implementing secure account management with Emergent OAuth for authentication and email services. Branding was thoroughly updated across the application. Recent efforts focused on streamlining tab layouts, implementing show archiving, a full Analytics tab redesign, and a consistent, responsive filter layout. The most critical work addressed persistent deployment regressions, meticulously debugging and fixing environment variable conflicts, domain mismatches, and database configuration for seamless production/preview operation, culminating in a robust solution for the deployed app's login.

<pending_tasks>
There are no explicit pending tasks from the user's requests that have not been attempted. The AI engineer has implemented solutions for all requested features and bugs. The immediate outstanding item is to verify the deployed application's login functionality in the production environment.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently addressing a critical issue where the deployed application's login functionality was reported as broken by the user. This occurred after previous fixes successfully restored login for the preview environment. The core of the problem was identified as an environment variable mismatch between the preview (development) and production deployment contexts, causing login failures due to incorrect backend URLs and database connections.

To resolve this, the AI engineer implemented a robust deployment configuration strategy:
1.  **Dedicated Environment Files**: Created  and  to store production-specific environment variables.
2.  **Runtime Detection**: Modified  in the frontend to include runtime detection logic. This logic dynamically determines if the application is running in a production environment (based on its domain, e.g.,  or ) and, if so, overrides the API URL to point to the correct production backend (e.g., ). This ensures the frontend correctly communicates with the production backend.
3.  **Database Configuration**: The  in  was explicitly set to  to correctly access the user's existing account data, as opposed to an empty production database (). This ensures that user accounts can be found upon login.
4.  **CORS Update**: Further updated the backend CORS configuration in  to include all relevant production domain patterns, ensuring proper cross-origin communication between the production frontend and backend.

This comprehensive solution aims to ensure that the production deployment automatically uses the correct backend URL and database configuration, thereby resolving the login failure. The preview environment's login is working correctly, and the deployed app is expected to function after this change.
