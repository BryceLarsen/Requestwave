The previous AI engineer successfully expanded the RequestWave application from an MVP to a freemium model. Key efforts initially focused on implementing Stripe payments, fixing complex backend routing conflicts (especially with webhooks and path parameters), and updating the frontend for a 14-day trial with corrected pricing. Significant UI/UX improvements included removing Pro badging, converting static buttons to toggles/dropdowns, and consolidating song management.

Following this, the engineer addressed user-reported bugs and new feature requests. A major part of the work involved enabling playlist management: allowing users to search by playlist, then adding functionality to create, rename, delete, and mark playlists as public/private. This required extensive backend (API endpoints, database schema updates for , , , and  in playlist responses) and frontend changes (UI for managing songs within playlists, drag-and-drop reordering, and a collapsible My Playlists section).

A persistent challenge throughout the latter part of the trajectory was debugging deployment and account-related issues. Multiple attempts were made to fix user login, subscription status, and playlist visibility, which were consistently hampered by misconfigurations (incorrect Stripe keys, hardcoded preview URLs) and, critically, platform-level deployment bugs preventing environment variables from syncing to production, and later, authentication endpoint routing issues specific to the custom domain. The last major finding was a database environment mismatch, where the AI was operating on a preview database while the user was testing production. The AI manually activated the user's account multiple times to facilitate testing while platform issues were escalated.

<product_requirements>
The RequestWave application empowers musicians to manage songs, requests, and tips, monetizing performances with a freemium model and Stripe subscriptions.

The product requirements evolved over the trajectory:
1.  **Audience Interface Enhancements (Partial):** Display artist social media links as buttons and make the artist's bio collapsible on the audience search page.
2.  **Comprehensive Freemium Model (Implemented):** Integrated Stripe for freemium. Artist dashboard is free, but audience links/QR codes are paywalled. Includes a 5 one-time startup fee, monthly (), and annual (8) subscriptions, with a 14-day free trial. The system minimizes Stripe transactions, re-charges startup fees for reactivations, manages  via webhooks, and enforces access with a page paused screen if inactive.
3.  **Frontend UI Alignment (Implemented):** Updated frontend for 14-day trial messaging, corrected pricing (8/year, total 3 with startup), changed checkout button to Start Free Trial Now, and replaced requests used bar with an Upgrade Now button.
4.  **Feature Access & UI Simplification (Implemented):** Made Song Suggestions a toggle switch and available to all users. Removed Pro badges/restrictions from the Design tab, artist photo upload, and Analytics tab.
5.  **UI Consolidation (Implemented):** Consolidated five song management buttons into a single dropdown menu.
6.  **Responsive Design (Implemented):** Implemented mobile responsiveness for navigation and welcome text.
7.  **Quick Start Guide (Implemented):** Removed automatic popup on login, kept accessible via a '?' button.
8.  **Playlist Management (Partially Implemented):** Introduced ability to create, rename, delete, set public/private, and add/remove/reorder songs within playlists, with corresponding UI.

<current_work>
The most recent work has primarily revolved around diagnosing and resolving critical deployment and account-related bugs impacting the application's core functionality in the production environment. While the AI engineer has implemented extensive features for playlist management (create, rename, delete, public/private toggle, song reorder/remove) and general UI improvements, these are not fully accessible to the user on the deployed version due to underlying infrastructure issues.

Specifically:
1.  **Playlist Management:** The complete playlist management system, including song reordering and deletion, plus playlist-level rename/delete/visibility features, has been developed and successfully tested in the preview environment. The My Playlists section is now a compact, collapsible dropdown in the Songs tab.
2.  **Account Status:** The user (brycelarsenmusic@gmail.com) repeatedly reported being in free mode and having their audience link paused, despite the AI engineer manually setting their account to Pro subscriber status and ensuring  is true in the database.
3.  **Deployment Environment Mismatch:** It was discovered that the AI engineer's testing (and therefore the fixes) were being applied to a *preview* environment's database, while the user was testing the *deployed production* environment. This meant fixes were not taking effect where the user was experiencing issues.
4.  **Configuration Issues:** Earlier, persistent problems were attributed to incorrect Stripe API keys in the backend's  and a hardcoded preview URL for  in the frontend's . These were addressed in the development environment and communicated to the user to apply in their deployment settings.
5.  **Platform Bugs:** Despite efforts, environment variables failed to sync to production (indicated by an orange warning bar in the deployment UI). Furthermore, external API routing, especially for authentication endpoints (), was intermittently broken or returning 500 errors on the custom domain (requestwave.app), preventing login and other critical functions even after  began working.
6.  **Current State:** The user can log in after temporarily removing the custom domain, but their account reverted to free mode. The AI engineer attempted to fix this via direct database updates, but the mismatch between preview and production databases caused the changes not to persist for the user. The core issue remains that database changes made during debugging are not reflected in the deployed environment the user is accessing.

The current situation is blocked by this environment mismatch and unresolved platform-level deployment issues.
