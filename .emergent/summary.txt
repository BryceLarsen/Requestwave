The previous AI engineer successfully implemented a freemium model with Stripe integration and various UI/UX improvements for the RequestWave application. Initial work focused on fixing backend routing conflicts and enhancing the frontend for the 14-day trial and new pricing. Significant effort was then dedicated to simplifying the UI by removing Pro badges and consolidating features into dropdowns.

A major portion of the recent work involved developing comprehensive playlist management functionalities, including creation, renaming, deletion, public/private toggling, and song reordering within playlists. This required extensive modifications to both backend API endpoints (adding , ,  to Playlist model, new CRUD endpoints) and frontend UI (new modals, drag-and-drop, state management).

A critical phase involved persistent debugging of deployment and account-related issues. Despite code fixes, the application faced problems with Stripe keys, incorrect frontend/backend URL configurations, and a database environment mismatch between preview and production. This led to a series of troubleshooting steps, including manual database updates for a specific user's account and repeated calls to support to resolve external routing and environment variable syncing issues. The latest interaction confirms a database environment mismatch causing account resets on the deployed version.

<product_requirements>
The RequestWave application empowers musicians to manage songs, process requests/tips, and monetize performances through a freemium model. It integrates Stripe for subscriptions, offering a 14-day free trial with a 5 startup fee and recurring monthly () or annual (8) plans. Key features include audience links, QR codes, and a page paused screen for inactive subscriptions.

The development trajectory addressed:
1.  **Comprehensive Freemium Model:** Full Stripe integration for subscriptions, managing  via webhooks, and enforcing access.
2.  **Frontend UI Alignment:** Updating trial messaging, pricing displays, checkout button text, and replacing requests used bar with Upgrade Now.
3.  **Feature Access & UI Simplification:** Making Song Suggestions a toggle available to all users, removing Pro badges from Design/Analytics tabs and photo upload.
4.  **UI Consolidation:** Merging five song management buttons into a single dropdown.
5.  **Responsive Design:** Adapting navigation for mobile screens.
6.  **Quick Start Guide:** Removing automatic popup, keeping accessibility via a '?' button.
7.  **Playlist Management:** Implementing playlist creation, renaming, public/private toggling, deletion, and song reordering/removal within playlists for both artist and audience views.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack structure.



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Core FastAPI backend.
    -   **Importance**: Handles all API endpoints including authentication, song/playlist management, request queue, profile updates, and payment integrations with Stripe. It encapsulates the application's business logic and interacts with MongoDB.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Freemium Model**: Updated  and  models. Implemented Stripe checkout, cancel, and status endpoints. Crucially, a robust Stripe webhook handler was added for subscription lifecycle events (, , ), including logic for a one-time startup fee and  management.
        -   **Routing**: Resolved path parameter conflicts by reordering routes and using .
        -   **Playlist Management**:
            -   Modified  and  models to include , , and .
            -   Added new endpoints:  for single playlist details,  to replace a playlist's song list,  to remove a single song,  for renaming and toggling public status, and  for soft deletion.
            -   Updated  and  to filter by  and .
            -   Ensured  is set on playlist creation and updates.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Main React component.
    -   **Importance**: Manages routing, global state, UI for musician/audience dashboards. Contains all frontend logic for backend interaction and renders various components based on user roles and subscription status.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   **Freemium UI**: Updated trial messaging (30 to 14 days), pricing (4 to 8), and unlimited requests messaging. Replaced requests used bar with Upgrade Now.
        -   **Feature Access & UI**: Removed Pro badges from Design/Analytics tabs and photo upload. Converted song suggestions to a toggle.
        -   **UI Consolidation**: Replaced five song management buttons with a single dropdown.
        -   **Responsive Design**: Implemented mobile-specific navigation and welcome text positioning.
        -   **Quick Start Guide**: Removed auto-popup.
        -   **Bug Fixes (ESLint/Scope)**: Relocated , , , , ,  functions to the correct components (primarily from  to  or defining them where needed) to resolve ESLint errors and scope issues.
        -   **Audience Interface (Initial Request)**: Changed Search Songs... to Search Song Title or Artist and replaced filter by Artist with a playlist dropdown. Integrated backend playlist fetching.
        -   **Musician Dashboard (User-requested Sync)**: Applied the same search placeholder and playlist dropdown changes as the Audience Interface. Modified client-side filtering logic to use playlist IDs (requiring backend to return  in ).
        -   **Playlist Management UI**: Implemented an Edit Playlist modal (or page) with drag-and-drop song reordering and individual song removal. Added rename functionality (inline edit), public/private toggling, and delete functionality for playlists within the My Playlists section. Integrated toast notifications and confirmation modals.

<current_work>
The most immediate work revolves around resolving critical deployment and account-specific issues preventing the application from functioning correctly on the production environment (), despite code fixes being in place.

Specifically, the user is unable to log in, and their account is stuck in free mode with the audience link paused. The My Playlists section (a recently developed feature for full playlist management including creation, reordering, deletion, and public/private toggling) is also not appearing on the deployed version.

Extensive troubleshooting by the previous AI engineer and the  has pinpointed the issues to **deployment configuration mismatches and infrastructure problems**:
1.  **Stripe API Keys**: Initially identified as placeholder keys in , though the user later stated they had set real keys in the deployment environment.
2.  **Frontend URL Configuration**:  in  was hardcoded to a preview URL, preventing communication with the custom domain. This was updated in code, but the changes were not syncing to production.
3.  **Environment Variable Syncing**: A persistent orange bar warning in the deployment window indicates environment variables are not syncing to production.
4.  **External API Routing (Custom Domain)**: While  works, authentication endpoints () return 500 errors via the custom domain, suggesting a Kubernetes ingress/proxy issue.
5.  **Database Environment Mismatch**: The most recent finding is that the testing agents were operating on a *preview environment's database*, while the user's login attempts and issues are with the *production database*. This means manual account fixes made by the agent in the preview DB are not reflected in the deployed production app.

The user temporarily removed the custom URL and was able to log in to the default Emergent URL, but their account was still not set to subscribed, and the audience link remained paused. A manual attempt by the agent to reactivate the user's account in the database (via testing agent interactions which hit the preview DB) failed to resolve the issue on the production deployment. The current state is that the user can log in with their old password (meaning the account exists), but it's in free mode.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to address the database environment mismatch by instructing the user how to fix their production account.
