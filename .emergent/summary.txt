The AI engineer effectively navigated a complex full-stack development trajectory, commencing with critical bug fixes related to frontend authentication and then transitioning into a phased feature development approach. Initial authentication issues and persistent playlist import bugs required iterative troubleshooting, including direct API testing, frontend state analysis, and extensive use of a  to pinpoint root causes (e.g., missing JWT headers, placeholder data returns). The engineer demonstrated adaptability by switching from full Spotify SDK integration to simpler web scraping, and then back to Client Credentials flow based on user feedback and technical feasibility for metadata extraction. Subsequently, the development shifted to implementing major enhancements for the artist dashboard, structured into three distinct phases: Song List Enhancements (filtering, batch editing, CSV export), Request Tracking & Popularity, and Analytics Dashboard. The process involved continuous backend and frontend testing, ensuring features were production-ready before moving to the next phase. The final task initiated was the automatic song metadata enrichment using Spotify API, which is currently in development.

<product_requirements>
The RequestWave application facilitates real-time interaction between live musicians and their audience. Musicians manage song lists (CSV upload, manual add/edit/delete), handle real-time requests with dedications/tips (Stripe), and gain insights into popularity. Audiences can browse/filter songs via QR code, make requests, and tip. Key features include a responsive web app, JWT authentication, polling for real-time updates (future WebSocket), MongoDB for data, and QR code generation. The app supports comprehensive filtering (Genre, Artist, Mood, Year with AND logic), a freemium model (7-day trial, then 20 requests/month; /month for unlimited), mobile optimization, Pro design options (color, layout, artist photo), and playlist import (Spotify/Apple Music). Recent enhancements include advanced song list filtering, batch editing/deletion with CSV export for musicians, song popularity tracking, and an analytics dashboard displaying audience emails, top songs, and tip summaries. The current development focuses on auto-populating song metadata (genre, year, mood) using Spotify API for manual song entry and CSV uploads.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently implementing the automatic song metadata enrichment feature. This involves integrating with the Spotify Web API (using Client Credentials flow) to fetch genre, year, and mood data based on song title and artist.

The backend has been updated in  to:
1.  Add  and  to .
2.  Install  (added to ).
3.  Implement Spotify client setup and metadata search functions.
4.  Expose a new API endpoint  for fetching song metadata.

On the frontend, in :
1.  New state variables () have been added to manage the auto-fill process.
2.  The  function has been created to call the new backend metadata search endpoint.
3.  An Auto-fill Info button has been added to the manual song entry form, specifically positioned after the 'Artist' input field and before the 'Genres' field.

The backend services have been restarted, and the frontend has been updated and restarted. The immediate next step is to test this newly implemented auto-fill functionality.
